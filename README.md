## What do I do?

I have worked as a technical architect in a wide variety of industries for 10+ years, and now offer my expertise as a **‚Äòhands-on‚Äô CTO**. I partner with startup founders, stakeholders and management.

I specialise in **cloud infrastructure**, **technical architecture** and **providing expertise on how to mode to a "low code movement"**, allowing businesses to specify their business logic *outside of the codebase* for flexibility and agility - saving vast amounts of time in development, **allowing time to create reliable, tested and secure code instead of rushed solutions**

I've worked on websites for fantastic companies with web traffic that is from 200K to 40Million hits over 8 hours, having worked with my valued clients:

## Open Source Contributions/Sponsorships

As **over 99% of software** uses some form of open source software however small, I sponsor a handful of open source projects and advise my clients to sponsor projects they rely on.

I volunteer my time **looking through the issue queues of packages I use** and contribute code to **fix bugs/add functionality** and provide feedback on ideas to issues that are raised.

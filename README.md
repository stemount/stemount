## Stephen Mount (stemount)

I have worked as a technical architect in a wide variety of industries for 10+ years, and now offer my expertise as a ‘hands-on’ CTO. I partner with startup founders, stakeholders and management.

I specialise in cloud infrastructure, technical review and providing services to "low code" business CRMs, allowing clients to put their business logic in a visual way.

I've worked on websites for fantastic companies with web traffic that is from 200K to 40Million hits over 8 hours, having worked with my valued clients:

## Open Source Contribution

As **over 99% of software** uses some form of open source software however small, I sponsor a handful of open source projects.

I volunteer my time looking through the issue queues of packages I use and contribute code to fix bugs, to enhance software, or even provide solutions ideas to issues that are raised.
